\chapter{Conclusion}

\paragraph{}
With the rise of Internet of Things and more powerful computers, we will be able to achieve Utopian homes using Smart Automation powered by Machine Learning Algorithms of higher complexity than Logistic Regression based linear model learning running on current amount of data. More data will lead to better prediction of potential user action which will help us lead more comfortable lives. Physically challenged people can also benefit from such systems which will eventually make them more independent, as more and more data gets collected to predict such users' habits. The impact of this technology on human lives will be deep and possibly every human-machine interface in the future will have some form of machine learning powered intelligent assistance. Changes in user habits can also be used to predict a lot of other things about the user such as the user's physical and mental health. In fact, many current technologies aim to provide basic level medical assistance using machine learning systems.
